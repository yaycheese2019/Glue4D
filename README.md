It is widely considered to be the succesor to Glue3D
Despite it's name, this engine does *not* support 4D graphics

# Features:
- Fast 3D Sprite-Based rendering
- Simple Entity logic system
- An amazing GUI interface for editing entities
- Quick Level design using rectangles
- Skybox support
- Built-in player controller
- 30+ example maps

# Player Controls

## Extra Info
In this repo are 2 files, 'glue4.sb3' which is the main project file, and 'datadef.txt' which has metadata about the entities
datadef.txt is not required for the project to run

This project uses custom extensions, so it only works when ran in Turbowarp.
